## Objective :
* Build a single application for object detection in contrasting datasets (coco and bloodcell).
* Analyze/compare relative performance of models on cloud platforms and Baremetal based on
the execution time as well as the modelâ€™s loss function thereby accounting for both the cloud
and machine learning aspects.
* [Furthermore, for demo - create a docker image for the entire application hosted on
IBM cloud using Kubernetes for orchestration.](http://159.122.181.44:32073/) 

## Repo Contains:

* Code - contains code and dataset 
* logs - containes logs for cloud and baremetal
* baremetal run.txt - contains all the commands used for baremetal
* Dockerfile - contains docker file for dockerization
* deploy.yaml & service.yaml - YAML files for Kubernetes
* training_driver.ipynb - notebook for running code on cloud
